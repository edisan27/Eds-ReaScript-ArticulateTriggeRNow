REAPER Version: 7.39 (as the time the code was written, but they do update very often!)

## What is this?
REAPER (DAW) plugin to simplify keyswitch articulation easier.
For this specific case, I use SubMission Audio's EuroBass III, you can adjust the code based on your liking

Showcase video soon!

### Current Features:
- [x] Key to open custom menu and select the list from there
- [x] Select MIDI note(s) you want to add, then select the desired keyswitch articulation

### To Do:
- [ ] Auto detect .lua script files instead of manually registering it to the menu .lua
