## Current Features:
- [x] Key to open custom menu and select the list from there
- [x] Select MIDI note(s) you want to add, then select the desired keyswitch articulation
- [x] Delete overlapping MIDI note if existing when the action is done

## To Do:
- [ ] Auto detect .lua script files instead of manually registering it to the menu .lua  
- [ ] Easier customization, maybe a single script instead of multiple for efficiency
